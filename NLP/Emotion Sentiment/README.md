# Project Overview
### This project aims to build an emotion detection system that classifies text into different emotion categories. By utilizing machine learning techniques, the system will analyze input text and predict one of several predefined emotions, such as joy, sadness, love, anger, fear, or surprise. The application is intended for real-time sentiment analysis, enabling users to input text and receive immediate feedback on the detected emotion.
