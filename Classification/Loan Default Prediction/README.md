# Project Overview
#### In this project, we will develop and evaluate multiple classification models to predict loan defaults.
#### Load the dataset and inspect its structure, data types, and check for missing values.
#### Prepare the features and target variable. Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
#### Standardize the features to ensure consistent scaling, which helps in improving model performance.
#### Train various classification models on the training data to identify the most effective model for predicting loan defaults.
#### Assess the performance of each model using metrics such as the confusion matrix, accuracy score, and ROC curve to determine their effectiveness.
#### Visualize the results with confusion matrices and ROC curves to compare model performances and understand their strengths and weaknesses.
## **( In the code, I only used Logistic Regression. However, you can see me using multible classifers down bellow )**
# First, try doing it on your own. If you struggle with something, you can find the steps outlined below.
